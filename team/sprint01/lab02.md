Meeting Time: lab02

Type of meeting: Second lab meeting

Team: Arnav Nayudu [x], Jake Yim [x], Kelvin Zhang [x], Rishabh Poikayil [x], Clifford Xu [] (Told us ahead of time that he'd be absent.), Alexander Granados [x], Jin Jeong [x]

Scribed Discussion:
The team got their individual demos approved by the instructors. 

We had a discussion about how to make our shopping extension different from our competitors. We decided to focus our efforts towards video games rather than casting a wider net and allowing for any product. The extension would scrape game selling websites, key selling websites, or marketplaces such as Amazon or Ebay to find cheaper listings of video games, physical or digital. 

The kanban board was assigned and will be discussed and completed over the next few days.

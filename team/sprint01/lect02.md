Scribed Discussion:

Team discussed the Cheapskate project and decided to move forward with the idea. 

We discussed implementing as an independent webapp versus as a Chrome extension, inspired by other shopping extensions. 

The team decided to try the Chrome extension approach, and explored web scraping options such as Selenium in order to implement the price matching feature.

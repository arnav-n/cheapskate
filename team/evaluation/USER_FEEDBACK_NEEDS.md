# User Feedback Needs

We would like to have user feedback on the following 3 items:

1. User Preference between: 
    - Adding games to a list in the same screen as the list is displayed 
    - A separate section or popout to add games to a list

2. User satisfaction with the home screen, which currently does not do anything useful or have a particular design

3. User satisfaction with the layout of their lists, and whether they need any organization features

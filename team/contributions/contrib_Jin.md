## Contributions

- Overall tried to provide help to other teammates whenever possible.
- Added a search bar to the Chrome extension pre-pivot.
- Primarily worked on trying to get the scraper to function on different websites (and got it to work), but we realized it was only really feasible with the Steam store, which led to the pivoting of our project.
- Handled the implementation of authorization and authentication in the web application through the use of Auth0's services, as well as any external setup required outside of the web app.
- Implemented the profile drop-down on the right side of the navbar that allows the user to log out of the web app, as well as lead them to their lists page.
- Ensured that certain features of the website were only visible to logged-in users on the web app.
- Set up the deployment of the web application's frontend and backend on Render.
  - Resolved issues that would occur in the deployment but would not show up in the local deployment.
- Oversaw the completion of the Design Document. Personally wrote the User Flow and UX Considerations section of the document.
  - Created the diagram visible in the User Flow and UX Considerations section.

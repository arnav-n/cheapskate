## Contributions


Scribed multiple sprints and retros and retros and commited them to the team documentation. 

When our product was a google chrome extension I fixed the display issues with the extension by gathering the data from the scraper and fitting it into a nice looking table, splitting the necessary info into different cells.

I also fixed the issue with the html being returned into the extension display.

When we switched over to the web app, I helped get the component to add games, formerly called form tab, working properly. I also created the list table component which retrieved all the lists that the user adds to the database, and then stores them in a table along with the userID of the user who added the list. 

Added additonal features to the form tab that allowed users to select which list they want to add their game to and linked the endpoints so that they could add games not on steam directly to their lists.

Worked on creating a delete feature to remove games for lists with other team members although wasn't able to get that done in time in the end.

Finally, I made many UI improvements and fixes to the app, using material ui on the list table component, form tab component, and dropdown, as well as the steam scraper overlay and table for each specific list.

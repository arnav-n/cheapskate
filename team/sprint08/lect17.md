User authentication and scraper have been fully integrated into the web application. Work on the user manual is also being continued. A majority of assigned tasks for the current user story being tackled this week have been completed and the three potential ideas for user evaluations have been finalized. In addition, the third (and possibly final) retrospective will be held today.

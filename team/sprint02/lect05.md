Scribed Discussion:

Team worked on building the MVP by taking on the issues in the Kanban board. There were not enough issues so multiple people were assigned to one issue. 

The icon for the extension, the search bar UI, and the scraper to find games was finished by the end of this meeting. The one last thing our team needs for our MVP is the feature to connect the submit button action on the search bar to the scraper script.

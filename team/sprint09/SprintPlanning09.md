Scribed Discussion:

The current focus is to finish all action items related to the in-progress stories due this week. The completion of these items will result in the successful implementation of all required functionality in the web application. In addition, unfinished parts of the user manual will be filled with the correct information while team members will also individually work on their contribution statements regarding the project. Due to the cancelled UX evaluations, some feedback based on team discussion will be considered and implemented into the application as needed.

Scribed Discussion:

Team continuing to work on the MVP. Considering either continuing to use Flask and Python to build a working web scraper or switching to use Javascript instead, so that we don't need to use Flask and this could simplify the implementation. 

In the end, we decided to go with Javascript to make the web scraper using the Playwrite library, as this simplifies not only the implementation of the web scraper, but also how it would interact and function with the Chrome extension.

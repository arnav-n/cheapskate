Team will work on building the minimum viable product by recreating the web scraper. Since the web scraper is now going to be written in Javascript, we can easily link the script to the action of a clickable button in the Chrome extension.

Team will build the new scraper using Playwrite and Javascript, as well as add event handling for a clickable search button on the extension display to run this webscraper.

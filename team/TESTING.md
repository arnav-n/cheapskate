1) The unit test requirement for lab05 will be done using MochaJS or Cypress and will be a part of the Extension folder. The intent is to check if the correct results are being returned from the scraper that was the primary base for our working MVP. This scraper will be integrated into the web application later.
2) The plan is to write unit tests for each individual GET and POST method being implemented since most of our features will be based on processing and retreiving user information from the connected database.
3) Yet to be decided. Currently in progress.

As of 2/17/23
1) The unit test requirement for lab05 will be done using MochaJS or Cypress and will be a part of web-app/backend. The intent is to verify if data inputted by the user into a form can be retrieved successully 
while they are logged into their account.
2) The plan is to write unit tests for each individual GET and POST method being implemented since most of our features will be based on processing and retreiving user information from the connected database.
3) Yet to be decided. Currently in progress.
4) Yet to be decided. Currently in progress.

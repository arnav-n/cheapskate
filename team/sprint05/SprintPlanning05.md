Scribed Discussion:

Team will work on pivoting to a full-stack web application in which the MVP features are implemented. The pivoting was necessary due to webscraping issues with other websites. The current idea is to create the application using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. By the end of this week, the application should be up and running with the original features ready to be implemented.

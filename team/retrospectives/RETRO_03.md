## Action item

* a goal: Link all of the different components that we have completed throughout our quarter in order to have a fully functioning web app
* a change: shift focus from creating new features and components to polishing the ones that we have already finished. This approach will help us ensure that our web app is fully functional and meets the needs of our users. We need to devote more time to testing and debugging our existing components, so that we can identify and address any issues that may arise.
* a measurement: When we have a fully functional web app that provides both usability and value for our users, while also having good looking UI. We can measuere this by the responses we recieve from our User Feedback Form.

## Retro Assessment

* I used the start stop continue retro process since we saw major team improvement after we implemnented it into our past two retros. 
* It was useful because it helped us identify what was slowing down our production and figure out how we can make changes to deliver the best project possible before the final deadline since we have less than two weeks to wrap our product up
* I would say that you should get every member of the group to partcipate in the retro since feedback from everybody is essential to getting a good Retro

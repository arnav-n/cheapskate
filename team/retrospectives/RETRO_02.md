## Action item

* a goal: Getting a more varied list of things to add to our web app to make it unique and a novel project.
* a change: Keep a more dynamic and organized Kanban board that can help determine which features that we need to add to the web app, it will allow us to see everyone's ideas for issues and figure out which ones we need to implement in priority order.
* a measurement: When we have a more populated new Kanban board and our web app is starting to reach a full MVP in a shorter period of time than our previous MVP (since we needed to do a last minute switch away from a Chrome extension) then we know that we have been making progress.

## Retro Assessment

* I used the start stop continue retro process just like we did in Retro1 to figure out what we should do to improve our team 
* It was useful because it helped us identify our flaws and figure out what we need to change to finish our project before the deadline since we had many obstacles and had to switch halfway through
* I would say that you should get everyone to partcipate in the retro since feedback from all the team members is helpful to getting a good Retro

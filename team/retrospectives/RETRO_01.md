* Led by: Kelvin 
* Present:  Arnav Nayudu [x], Jake Yim [x], Kelvin Zhang [x], Rishabh Poikayil [x], Clifford Xu [x], Alexander Granados [x], Jin Jeong [x]

## Action item

* a goal: Better communication and a better spread out division of work to complete more tasks 
* a change: Work on the project throughout the week instead of just doing work in class and make sure all the tasks are divided properly
* a measurement: When we have a more populated Kanban board and we are getting a higher volume of tasks put in the done section by the end of the week that's how we can measure that our progress has improved

## Retro Assessment

* I used the start stop continue retro process to figure out what we should do to improve our team 
* It was useful because it helped us identify our flaws and figure out what we need to change to complete our tasks properly
* I would say that to keep it simple is better because usually the most major flaws aren't super specific but just general things to change.

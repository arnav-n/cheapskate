1. When one of us is absent for an unavoidable reason, we will let the other team members know as early as possible. 

2. We will all try to keep such absences to a minimum.

3. Those of us that are present will share with the absent team members what they missed and help them get back up to speed.

4. Remember to have fun along the way!

Scribed Discussion:

Team will finish up the basic functionalities of our product to make the MVP work properly. We still need to find a way to run our script on a server so that users can download the chrome extension wihout having to download the script themselves.

Team will try using Broswerify to write and use our Node.js-style modules that compile for use in the browser. Team will also try getting the final scraped games to display in a nice UI on the extension.

Most of the team members are familiar with the concept of webscraping but not with the actual coding process. However, every member is skilled in Python and Javascript.
Therefore, learning to use the BeautifulSoup library for the purposes of the project would not be much of an issue. The team is also well-versed in HTML and CSS, which is
what will be primarily used for building the Chrome extension application.

The current plan to learn how to use the BeautifulSoup library is to check out the Python docs and use Youtube tutorials to supplement our learning process. By the end of this
quarter, we expect to have a solid understanding of webscraping.

Present Plan (1/31 - Present):\
We will continue to use HTML, CSS, and JS for building the Chrome Extension. However, JS will be used instead of Python for the webscraping process because it allows us to display the data on the extension with lesser difficulty. The Playwright API will be used for the purposes of webscraping.

Previous Plan (1/17 - 1/31):\
Most of the team members are familiar with the concept of webscraping but not with the actual coding process. However, every member is skilled in Python and Javascript.
Therefore, learning to use the BeautifulSoup library for the purposes of the project would not be much of an issue. The team is also well-versed in HTML and CSS, which is
what will be primarily used for building the Chrome extension application.

The current plan to learn how to use the BeautifulSoup library is to check out the official documentation and use Youtube tutorials to supplement our learning process. By the end of this
project, we expect to have a solid understanding on how to implement webscraping.

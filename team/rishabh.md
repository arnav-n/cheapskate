My name is Rishabh Poikayil and I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in computer science at UC Santa Barbara. I am currently taking CMPSC 148 as an upper-division elective in Winter 2023, for which I am required to describe my ideas for the project I have selected along with my team.

My team's idea involves building a webscraper to search for the lowest prices at which an item is sold, given that the item was searched by the user. The intent is to display these prices along with a description of the item to the user and allow them to choose which option they prefer.

I believe that this can be best accomplished by choosing a tech stack that is suitable for the team's needs and is also quite easy to learn and use. Perhaps a combination of Javascript with Selenium to scrape the web would be the best place to begin with development. React could be a suitable framework for displaying the data while Heroku or Firebase can be used for the backend. However, my teammates may have better approaches as well.

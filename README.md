## Project Details

## User Roles
We essentially only have one user role, which is the user of the extension. There is no need for any sort of admin maintenance, other than on the developing end. There is only one type of user, and it is the person inputting information to the extension.

The user will be able to open the extension, have the extension take in the name of a video game that they are looking for, and the extension will output a list of the cheapest listings of that particular video game on different websites. The user will be able to click on each these listings to open a new tab leading to that listing on each website.

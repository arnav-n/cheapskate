## Cheapskate Manual

# Product Purpose

This web application is a project for CMPSC 148 and is a tool for video game enthusiasts to log, rate, and create lists of their favorite games as per their desire. 

Users can find games via searching on the application (if the game is available on Steam) or entering details manually in our add game form. They can also share the lists publicly so that other users can view them as well which will allow them to see what games their friends are playing and enjoy as well!


# Intended user audience

If you are a gaming enthusiast or critic and want to see how other likeminded people like you are gaming then Cheapskate is the website for you.
